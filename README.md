Welcome to my collection of physics simulations and graphs!
This repository showcases several coded models that explore different topics in physics through computational visualization.
Each simulation was built to better understand how physical systems behave and how numerical methods can be used to approximate real-world dynamics 
and because I enjoy transforming the abstract thoery of physics into something tangible.

I am trying to learn more about numerical methods to make more complex simulations that can better describe phenomena.
